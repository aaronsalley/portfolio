Flexible payment options promise growth.
Introduced poorly, they create confusion, risk, and erosion of trust.
At B&H, the question wasn’t whether customers would use buy now, pay later or a private label credit card. The demand was clear. The harder question was how to introduce financial flexibility without distorting the experience or exposing the business to unnecessary risk.
The work required two distinct decisions—made in sequence.

At an enterprise level, B&H needed modern payment and loyalty capabilities to remain competitive in high-consideration retail. BNPL and private label credit offered clear upside: higher conversion, larger baskets, and stronger repeat behavior.
At the same time, the mobile and checkout experience was in the middle of significant transformation. Introducing new payment mechanics too early—or too visibly—would have layered complexity onto an experience still being stabilized.
The surface opportunity looked like conversion lift.
The deeper risk was premature exposure.
Payment flexibility is not neutral. It affects trust, compliance, reconciliation, customer understanding, and long-term relationship. Once introduced publicly, it is difficult to retract.
The real problem wasn’t what to offer.
It was when and how to make it real.

At the enterprise level, financial products carry structural consequences: regulatory obligations, partner dependencies, accounting complexity, and operational risk.
At the customer level, they sit at a moment of maximum sensitivity—checkout—where clarity and confidence matter more than choice.
Moving too slowly risked falling behind market expectations.
Moving too quickly risked confusing customers and burdening teams with cleanup.
The goal wasn’t optionality.
It was earned flexibility.

The first decision was to separate capability readiness from customer exposure.
Before anything appeared in checkout, the focus was on building the enterprise foundation: programmatic integration with BNPL and private label credit partners, internal processes for reconciliation and reporting, and clear ownership across finance, legal, and operations.
This work was intentionally invisible to customers. The objective was not adoption—it was stability. The capability had to function predictably under real volume before it could responsibly shape the customer experience.
Only once that foundation was in place did the second decision come into play: how to introduce new payment options digitally without distorting the checkout funnel.
The checkout experience was treated as a trust surface, not a feature canvas. Payment options were surfaced deliberately—placed, labeled, and sequenced to support understanding rather than impulse. The goal was to make flexibility available without forcing a decision, and to ensure customers who didn’t need these options were never slowed by their presence.
Crucially, this rollout occurred after mobile platform consolidation and core journey improvements were already underway. The experience was coherent enough to support added flexibility without fragmenting behavior or brand.
The work wasn’t about launching quickly.
It was about sequencing exposure to match readiness.

B&H introduced BNPL and private label credit in a way that felt integrated rather than promotional.
At the enterprise level, the organization gained durable financial capabilities it could trust—supported by clear processes and predictable behavior. At the customer level, flexible payment options increased choice without introducing friction or confusion at checkout.
Because the capability was stable before it was visible, learning focused on customer behavior and value creation—not operational remediation. Teams could iterate with confidence, and customers encountered flexibility as support, not pressure.

Financial flexibility only works when it’s sequenced correctly.
Capability earns trust first—experience earns it second.
