Case Study: Transforming B&H Photo Video Pro Audio's Mobile Experience for Revenue Growth

B&H Photo Video Pro Audio, a renowned institution in New York City, has set industry standards for retail sales in consumer electronics. Initially hired to maintain mobile app offerings, the project evolved to address underlying user experience issues despite winning the App of the Year at the Mobile Shopping Summit and the first ever Material Design Award for Immersive Imagery in 2015. This case study explores the transformation that occurred over six years, making the mobile suite a substantial revenue generator and an integral part of B&H's eCommerce strategy.

Background:
B&H, founded in 1973, has been a trusted leader in providing photo, video, audio, and computer gear. The brick-and-mortar store, originally in Tribeca, moved twice to accommodate its growth. In the 2000s, the company embraced online sales, becoming a significant revenue source. Facing challenges in the mobile domain, the need for a strategic shift became evident.

The Challenge:
While accolades highlighted B&H's mobile app, underlying user experience issues impacted user acquisition and revenue. The discrepancy in visual identity across platforms needed addressing. Senior Executives sought justification for the value of mobile offerings within the broader eCommerce strategy.

The Solution:

1. Shipping Calculator: Improved accuracy and transparency in shipping costs.
2. Checkout and Product Detail: Streamlined for a seamless user experience.
3. DealZone: Engaging users with exclusive deals.
4. Android & Mobile Web to PWA: Transition from a native Android app to a Progressive Web App (PWA) for financial gains and consistent user experience.
5. Research & PRD Methods: Robust research methodologies for informed product development.
6. Private Label Credit Card: Introduced to enhance customer loyalty and encourage repeat business.

Implementation:
Over six years, the mobile suite transformed into a significant revenue generator, contributing to almost half of all eCommerce transactions. The visual narrative approach, combined with UI enhancements, facilitated a smooth user journey from Product Detail Page (PDP) to checkout, meeting the business requirement of welcoming a new generation of customers. The decision to sunset the native Android app in favor of a PWA proved financially beneficial and provided consistent user experience across platforms.

Results:

1. Financial Success: The mobile suite became a substantial revenue generator.
2. Consistent User Experience: PWA ensured consistent UX across Android and mobile web platforms.
3. Efficient Development: Shared code base streamlined development and feature releases.
4. Adaptability: Continual evaluation for potential migration of Swift code for iOS compatibility.

In an ever-evolving economy, maintaining a strong mobile presence is crucial for a healthy conversion funnel. B&H's investment in transforming its mobile experience not only addressed initial challenges but also positioned the company for sustained success. The decision to embrace PWA showcased adaptability and a commitment to meeting evolving customer expectations. The merits of this investment are evident, promising continued dividends into the future.
