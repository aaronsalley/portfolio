As mobile scaled, the product detail page quietly became one of the most important surfaces in the experience.
Customers were spending more time researching on smaller screens—comparing specifications, reading reviews, and building confidence before committing to purchase.
The opportunity wasn’t visual polish.
It was decision support.

PDPs carried increasing responsibility but inconsistent structure. Content density, hierarchy, and interaction patterns varied across platforms, creating friction at the moment customers needed clarity most.
The surface issue looked like layout.
The deeper issue was cognitive strain.
Customers weren’t lacking information—they were working too hard to interpret it.

In high-consideration retail, PDPs don’t just inform.
They reassure.
Without coherence, even strong content loses effectiveness. The goal wasn’t to simplify products—it was to simplify understanding.

Rather than redesigning PDPs in isolation, the work treated them as a system surface—one where clarity, performance, and brand expression needed to travel together.
As the platform simplified, PDP became a place where learning could travel—one design decision improving discovery, evaluation, and confidence everywhere at once.
The work emphasized hierarchy, progressive disclosure, and consistency across categories—allowing customers to focus on differences that mattered, not noise.

PDPs became easier to scan, easier to compare, and easier to trust—particularly on mobile.
Customers spent more time engaging with content that mattered and less time navigating around it. The experience felt calmer, more intentional, and more distinctly B&H.

Good design doesn’t reduce information.
It reduces effort.
