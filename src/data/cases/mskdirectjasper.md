MSK Direct Jasper

Building a frictionless cancer navigation platform from zero

The Problem

Cancer care is clinically complex, emotionally overwhelming, and operationally fragmented. MSK Direct needed a way to extend Memorial Sloan Kettering’s expertise beyond its walls—without burdening members with confusing workflows or overwhelming internal teams with manual operations. The challenge wasn’t access alone; it was timing, relevance, and scale.

The Opportunity

Employers and channel partners wanted trusted, expert cancer support—but only if it felt simple, personalized, and immediately valuable. This created an opportunity to design a digital-first experience that proactively guided members to the right care at the right moment, while supporting millions of covered lives nationwide.

My Role

I led the product vision and 0→1 execution of MSK Direct Jasper, partnering with Jasper Health, clinical leaders, engineering, and operations. I owned strategy, roadmap, experience design, and platform integration—aligning business goals, clinical rigor, and member experience into a single, scalable product.

The Solution

We built a white-labeled app and web platform that delivered:
• Proactive engagement powered by claims data and self-reported inputs
• Tiered access models aligned to employer agreements (Premium vs. Basic)
• Expert Medical Opinions (EMOs) and digital self-service workflows
• Care navigation and coordination via MSK Care Advisors and Jasper Health Navigators
• Secure identity, eligibility, and SSO integration across MSK and partner systems

The experience was designed to feel effortless for members—and operationally lightweight for the organization.

The Outcome
• Replaced manual, service-heavy workflows with scalable digital experiences
• Enabled national expansion across employers and channel partners
• Increased member engagement, utilization, and satisfaction
• Created a durable platform supporting millions of covered lives across the full cancer journey

Why It Matters

This wasn’t just a new product—it was a new operating model. MSK Direct Jasper proved that expert cancer care can be delivered digitally, personally, and at scale—without sacrificing trust, quality, or clinical integrity.
